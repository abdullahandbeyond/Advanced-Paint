# Advanced-Paint
# Augmented Interactions

**Desciption:

We built an interactive system that allows users to perform digital drawing using different schemes. It was built using the Processing environment, which is an open-source language-software that helps building digital art apps and functions. It includes a text editor, compiler, display window, and many built-in libraries to make it easy to build a visual artistic system.
Our system provides two ways for the user to draw a feature. One is using selection keys and a mouse. The other way is using gestures with the mouse. We did a usability test with some people to evaluate which one of the two schemes is better. You can find the usability feedback forms in the "Evaluation" section on our project submission doc here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vboEkCTAplhZlcsCaNdcOpCLfWi1zz7T/view

**The main features of the program are:

1.	Shapes: Free-form lines, straight lines, ellipse and rectangle.
2.	Line weight: Thin, medium and thick weights of the lines.
3.	Colors: Black, red, green and blue of the lines that are drawn.
4.	Undo feature: Undo of the shapes from the last entry of the drawings.
5.	Current selection: A box on the top right corner of the screen showing the current selection (1, 2 and 3). It also blinks as feedback to user if there is an action is performed.
6.	Customized cursor: A customized cursor which blinks if user presses the mouse buttons.
7.  Gesture recognition: Mouse based basic gesture recognition of feature selection.
